# Data_Mining_Project

Using various classifications, this study seeks to investigate the Census Income Features Set. There have been many articles published recently about the economic situation in the United States. The economy is often evaluated based on household and individual income.

When predicting salaries, we’re able to use the data set Adult Census Income to see the attributes that can be used to predict the result. We notice that the economic status of an individual is heavily dependent on several factors such as occupation, relationship status, education, and their native country. This is where the Census Database from 1994 comes in, which is a clean records database extracted by Barry Becker 

There are several classification methods we will be using are Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Naïve Bayes, and K-Neighbors Classifier. Our aim is to find the most accurate classifier that can accurately predict whether a person is making lower or over 50K. Furthermore, to see if we can more accurately predict our result.
